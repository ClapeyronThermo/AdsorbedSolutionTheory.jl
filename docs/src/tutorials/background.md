# Models in adsorption equilibrium

Adsorption is a surface phenomenon where atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid adhere to the surface of another material. This process results in the formation of a thin film of the adsorbed substance (the adsorbate) on the surface of the material it adheres to (the adsorbent) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption)).

In thermodynamics, just as equations of state are used to describe the equilibrium properties of fluids in single and multiphase systems, adsorption models are employed to characterize the equilibrium thermodynamics of adsorption processes. The number of degrees of freedom (DoF) required to fully specify the equilibrium condition is determined by the **Gibbs phase rule**:

```math
DoF = N_{species} - N_{phases} + 2
```

DoF is the number of so-called intensive state properties (or, in other words, those that are independent of system size) that we need to provide to fully specify the intensive properties of the a system in equilibrium.

Adsorption is a process involving 2 phases - fluid and solid (adsorbent). This leads to:

```math
DoF = N_{species}
```
